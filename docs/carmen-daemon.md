# Carbon Daemon
The Carbon Daemon is a specialized reporting tool designed to help you track and understand the environmental footprint of your cloud infrastructure **in Azure**. It generates comprehensive reports detailing the carbon emissions and energy consumption of your cloud resources, with particular emphasis on compute resources like virtual machines.

## Expected Source File Format

The daemon expects to read a group of csv files containing resource usage data. Below is a description for each column expected in the CSV input.

| Field | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Time | Timestamp when the measurement was recorded, typically in ISO 8601 format | 2024-10-15T14:30:00Z |
| Id | Unique identifier for the virtual machine resource | vm-a1b2c3d4e5f6 |
| Size | VM instance size or tier (defines CPU, memory, and performance characteristics) | Standard_D4s_v3 |
| Region | Geographic location or data center where the VM is deployed | eastus, westeurope, ap-southeast-1 |
| Service | Cloud service or product category the VM belongs to | Compute, Azure Virtual Machines, EC2 |
| Component | Logical component or application layer the VM serves | web-server, database, api-gateway |
| Subscription | Cloud subscription or account identifier | prod-subscription-001 |
| Name | Human-readable name assigned to the VM | production-web-01 |
| Instance | Instance identifier or number within a deployment group | instance-01, web-server-03 |
| Environment | Deployment environment designation | production, staging, development |
| Partition | Logical partition, tenant, or organizational division | customer-a, team-finance, partition-1 |
| AverageCpuPercentage | Average CPU utilization during the measurement period (0-100) | 45.7 |
| DiskSizeGb | Total provisioned disk storage in gigabytes | 128 |

## Report File

The Carmen Daemon generates a detailed carbon emissions report in CSV format with the following fields:

| Field | Description | Example |

| Name | Human-readable name of the virtual machine | prod-db-vm-001 |
| Region | Azure region where the VM is deployed | francecentral |
| Subscription | Cloud subscription or account identifier | production-subscription-01 |
| EnergyKWh | Total energy consumed in kilowatt-hours during the reporting period | 0.1126 |
| OperationalCarbonGramsCO2eq | Carbon emissions from energy consumption during operation (grams of CO2 equivalent) | 4.9551 |
| EmbodiedCarbonGramsCO2eq | Carbon emissions from hardware manufacturing, transport, and disposal (grams of CO2 equivalent) | 6.1248 |
| TotalCarbonGramsCO2eq | Sum of operational and embodied carbon emissions (grams of CO2 equivalent) | 11.08 |
| CarbonIntensity | Carbon intensity of the France Central electricity grid (grams CO2eq per kWh) | 44.0 |
| VMSize | Azure VM instance size/SKU | Standard_E16ads_v5 |
| Service | Application or service name | couchbase |
| Instance | Specific instance identifier within the service | db-instance-001 |
| Environment | Deployment environment | prd |
| Partition | Logical partition or tenant | (empty) |
| Component | Infrastructure component type | db |

## Running The Daemon

The example-data directory includes sample VM usage datasets you can use to explore and test Carbon Engine. The configuration below demonstrates how to run the engine in local-reader mode, processing example VM metrics and generating carbon reports locally.

```yaml
# Example Configuration for Carbon Engine with Sample Data
# This configuration uses the local reader to process the example VM metrics
carmen_daemon:
  # SOURCE: Read VM metrics from local example data
  source:
    type: local

    # Files to process - choose one or more:
    # Option 1: Simple example (2 VMs, 3 hours each)
    file_names:
      - "vm_metrics_simple.csv"

    # Option 2: Full monthly data (6 VMs, January)
    # file_names:
    #   - "vm_metrics_2024_01.csv"

    # Option 3: Multi-month data (January + February)
    # file_names:
    #   - "vm_metrics_2024_01.csv"
    #   - "vm_metrics_2024_02.csv"

    # Local filesystem configuration
    local:
      # Path to the example data directory
      # Using relative path from project root
      source_path: "vm-metrics"

      # Or use absolute path:
      # source_path: "/home/user/carbon-engine/example-data/vm-metrics"

  # UPLOAD: Write carbon reports to local output directory
  upload:
    type: local
    # Local filesystem configuration
    local:
      # Output directory for carbon reports
      upload_path: "./output"
```

To run the example, navigate to the `example-data/` directory and execute the following command:

```bash
cd example-data/
carbon-daemon
```


## Reading and Uploading to Azure Blob Storage
The daemon currently supports reading from and writing to Azure Blob Storage. To enable this, you must provide the required Azure configuration parameters. Refer to the configuration section of the documentation for details on the necessary settings.
